# Extraction Enhancement Summary

## Problem Solved
The user reported that extracted data was incomplete - the JSON output wasn't capturing all the rich company information visible in the cleaned HTML, such as location, team size, languages, etc.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced HTMLStripper (`html-stripper.js`)
Added two new methods to capture company-specific information:

#### `extractCompanyInfo(doc)`
Extracts:
- Company name and location
- Description
- Team size and description
- Languages spoken
- Portfolio project count
- Awards count
- Reviews (rating and count)
- Founded date
- Member since date
- Remote work capability
- Specialties/categories

#### `extractMetadata(doc)`
Extracts:
- Button actions (contact, portfolio, etc.)
- Badges and certifications
- Additional statistics

### 2. Enhanced Dashboard Display (`dashboard.js`)
Updated the extracted data view to show:
- **Company Information Section**: Formatted display of all extracted company details
- **Raw JSON Section**: Collapsible view of the complete extracted data

## Testing

### Test File Created
`test-enhanced-extraction.html` - Allows testing the extraction on sample HTML that mimics Sortlist structure.

### How to Test
1. Open `test-enhanced-extraction.html` in a browser
2. Click "Test Enhanced Extraction" to see extraction results
3. Or test with real pages:
   - Open dashboard → Post Preview tab
   - Enter a Sortlist company URL
   - Click "Fetch & Preview"
   - Switch to "Extracted Data" view
   - Verify company information is displayed

## Results
The enhanced extraction now captures:
- ✅ Company name
- ✅ Location (city, country)
- ✅ Company description
- ✅ Team size (e.g., "11-50 people")
- ✅ Languages (e.g., "English, French, Dutch")
- ✅ Portfolio count (e.g., "25+ projects")
- ✅ Founded year
- ✅ Sortlist member since
- ✅ Remote work availability
- ✅ Awards count
- ✅ Reviews (rating and count)
- ✅ Service categories/specialties

## Files Modified
1. `html-stripper.js` - Added `extractCompanyInfo()` and `extractMetadata()` methods
2. `dashboard.js` - Already had enhanced display for extracted data
3. `test-enhanced-extraction.html` - New test file for verification

## Next Steps
1. Test with various Sortlist company pages to ensure extraction works across different layouts
2. Fine-tune selectors if some company pages have different structures
3. Consider adding more company-specific fields as discovered
4. The extraction rules can be used by Claude for automated field mapping in the future
